🖼️ Image Classification Project
This project is a Python-based image classification system that uses machine learning to identify and categorize images into predefined classes. It demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), to accurately predict image labels.

🔍 Features
Image preprocessing and augmentation

Model training using CNN (or specify model like ResNet, VGG, etc.)

Classification of new/test images

Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, etc.)

Option to load/save trained model

⚙️ How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
python image_classifier.py
🧠 Model Used
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

(Optionally mention: Transfer learning model like ResNet50, VGG16, etc.)
